## Setup process
1. Replace the placeholder variables with the username, pass, server, and database name. 
2. Set up an ODBC data source on your computer.
  a. For Windows, that means typing "ODBC" in the search bar and selecting "ODBC data sources (32-bit)"
  b. Add "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL server". The name and description are for your benefit, the server name must match the server you're working on.
  c. Authenticate with SQL Server Authentication, and use the credentials you were given. 
  d. Continue through and select finish, then verify that the tests connect properly.
  e. Verify that the program loads when you run it.
  
## Editing process
1. There's not a clear agenda here, but I'm sure someone will explain it to whoever's working on this.
